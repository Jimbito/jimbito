### Hi, welcome to my Github page ðŸ‘‹

I'm a University of Manchester graduate with a Master's degree in Physics. Following my studies in physics, I am now training in Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering at AiCore. This Github page displays some of my projects completed whilst with my colleagues at AiCore, as well as my own personal projects, pursued out of my love for coding. Currently I am working on a modular web scraping program, which I will apply with my team at AiCore to compare price and product data between two highstreet clothing brands, Uniqlo and Primark. 

If you have any question about any repo, or want to contact me, don't hesitate to:
